Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
Key domains of AI include:
- Machine Learning (ML): Teaching computers to learn patterns from data.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enabling computers to understand and generate human language.
- Computer Vision: Allowing machines to interpret and process visual information from the world.
- Robotics: Building systems that can perform actions in the physical world.

AI is used in applications like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, fraud detection, and more.
